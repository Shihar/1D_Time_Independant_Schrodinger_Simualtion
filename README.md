# 1D_Time_Independant_Schrodinger_Simualtion

The Schrodinger's Wave Equation is an important mathematical model which is highly used to describe the behaviour of Quantum Particles. This is analogous to the classical
mechanics of Energy of particles which is combination of potential and kinetic energy. This presents the behaviour an electron in different potential well in 1D. 

There are two numerical methods employed to plot the behaviour of the particle.
1. Eigen Method - The Standard Method to solve Schrodinger's Equation 
2. Shooting Method - This is used to solve symmetrical potential functions where boundary value is known. 

The codes are written in MATLAB and a report describing the impelementation and results are attached as well.
